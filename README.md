# FiveM-Server-Sector

## About 
Using FiveM's bucket system I created a resource that allows the server owners to create different sectors of the server. 
*This gamestate-split feature exists in FiveM by default, I just made a resource so it can be used easier.*

## Usage
All you have to do is edit the config file. I included a little documentation so you can understand it better.
If you have any questions feel free to ask me in messages, or here under this post.
